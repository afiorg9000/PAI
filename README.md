# PAI (Personal AI)

PAI is a conversational AI assistant designed to assist in achieving self-actualization through an array of functionalities. Originally created to automate the journey through Maslow's hierarchy of needs framework, PAI offers a unique blend of AI-driven features to improve productivity, enhance accountability, and help manage time effectively. Built using OpenAI's Davinci API and Python, this project showcases the capability to create innovative AI solutions.

## Key Features

- **Autonomous Codebase Development**: Streamline development processes by generating, saving, and managing code files automatically.
  
- **Speech Recognition**: Hands-free, voice-based interactions for improved workflow integration.

- **Task Creation with External Accountability**: Assign tasks with financial stakes to keep yourself motivated.

- **Automated Pomodoro Session Management**: Optimal time management through focus sessions and self-assessment features.

## Impact

- Faster time-to-market through autonomous codebase development.
- Intuitive, hands-free workflow integration.
- External task accountability for increased motivation.
- Enhanced work-life balance through automated Pomodoro sessions.

## Background

- The first version of PAI was a simpler conversational AI with only 10 lines of training data but achieved high accuracy.
  
- The project gained traction after a presentation at an AI event, encouraging further development.

- Technologies used: OpenAI's Text Davinci and GPT-3.5 Turbo for the Language Learning Model (LLM), Python for other functionalities, and VS Code as the IDE.

## How It Works

1. **Conversational Generative AI**: Built using OpenAI's API.
2. **File Manipulation**: Generate, save, open, and manage code files.
3. **Task Creator**: Keep yourself accountable by creating tasks with financial stakes.
4. **Focus Mate**: Automated Pomodoro sessions with self-assessment features.
5. **Speech Recognition**: Communicate with PAI through voice or text.

### Extra: Financial Accountability

Assign a specific amount of money to each task and designate someone who will receive the money if you fail to complete it. This creates a unique financial incentive to stay motivated.

## Challenges

- The most significant challenge faced was debugging the code to ensure all functionalities work simultaneously.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/afiorg9000/PAI.git
    ```

3. Run the PAI assistant
    ```
    python main.py
    ```
